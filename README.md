# ionic2-Todo-App
Todo app developed on top of Ionic 2 Framework with the extra feature of pinning , hiding and setting expiry time for todo items.

This app is written on TypeScript.

Its a basic todo app, and datas are not persisted. You can create unlimited Todo items. When you're creating Todo, expiry time is also set along with it. And once the expiry time is past, the item will be removed from list automatically unless the item is pinned

Pinning the item helps to not to remove the todo once expiry time is past.

1. Run npm install
2. Run ionic serve
